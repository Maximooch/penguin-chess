## Overview
This is a fully functional chess game that runs in any modern web browser. It implements all standard chess rules including special moves like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.

## Features
- Complete chess rules implementation
- Interactive board with move highlighting
- Game state tracking (check, checkmate, stalemate)
- Move history with undo functionality
- Captured pieces display
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Files Structure
- `index.html` - Main game page
- `css/style.css` - Game styling
- `js/chess-logic.js` - Core game logic and state management
- `js/chess-pieces.js` - Piece movement rules
- `js/chess-mechanics.js` - Game mechanics like check detection
- `js/ui.js` - User interface components
- `js/app.js` - Application initialization
- `server.py` - Simple Python server for running the game
- `run_chess.bat`/`run_chess.sh` - Scripts to easily start the game
- `debug.html` - Diagnostic tool for troubleshooting

## How to Run
1. Use one of the run scripts (`run_chess.bat` for Windows or `run_chess.sh` for Unix)
2. Alternatively, open `index.html` directly in a browser
3. For server-based hosting, use the included Python server

## Technical Implementation
- Pure vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries)
- Object-oriented design with separation of concerns
- Modular code organization
- Unicode chess symbols for piece representation
- CSS Grid for board layout
- Event-based interaction handling

## Possible Enhancements

- Implement multiplayer over network
- Add move notation (algebraic notation)
- Allow custom piece sets/themes
- Save/load game functionality
- Timer for timed matches

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
1. Open `debug.html` to run diagnostics
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify all files are in the correct locations
4. Ensure your browser is up to date
